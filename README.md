# cs50: Snake
This is my final project for the [Harvard CS50X](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020) course. 
It is the classic snake game implemented in lua(LÖVE).
It is the better version than my [original snake game](https://github.com/aabishkaryal/SnakeGame) made with p5js. 

## Requirements:

2. Clone this project either by downloading zip or with `git clone https://github.com/aabishkaryal/cs50-snake.git`
3. Drag the project directory to love.exe or shortcut to love.exe.
